# ExploitGPT

Combining the power of nmap and OpenAI to create a tool that scans an IP or URL and directly outputs relevant exploits via ExploitDB. OpenAI api responses are dynamic and subject to change. 

## How to run ExploitGPT
In order to run this program, go to [OpenAPI](https://openai.com/product) and sign up for an API key.  Add this key to your kali env.

Once the ExploitGPT package has been downloaded and the API key added, run ExploitGPT.  The prompt will ask you to input either an IP or URL (shout out to a colab project I worked on for inspo - [Project Oracle](https://github.com/Josh512/ProjectOracle)).  

After scanning the target, the program will output open services and versions.  With this info, openai will pull relevant info from ExploitDB and output in list form, different exploits to use on the target.
